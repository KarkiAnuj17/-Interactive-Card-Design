# Interactive Card Design

This project showcases an interactive card-based UI where cards loop infinitely while scrolling, and the card in the center dynamically zooms in for a visually engaging effect. Users can also drag to scroll through the cards, making it an intuitive experience.

## Features
- **Dynamic Card Looping**: Cards loop infinitely as you scroll up or down.
- **Center Card Zooming**: The card in the center of the container is dynamically zoomed in for emphasis.
- **Drag to Scroll**: Users can click and drag to scroll through the cards.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is styled to adapt to different screen sizes.
